# Repository created for the course YSC4224

This is an experiment.  
I would like you (students) to work on a data science project as a team and collaborate in GitHub to have this as an experience that is as close as possible to the professional world that you can find outside without too many complexities.

Once you get the foundations, you can practice more, find interesting projects, contribue and also put this in your resume when you look for work in the future :-)  .

We will implement the code for Linear Regression with Gradient Descent.
You will practice:
* Team collaboration and different roles you can play in the team.
* Individual Contributor Work.
* Learn one way to use git and GitHub to collaborate with the team to complete a project.
