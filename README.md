# Repository created for the course YSC4224

This is an experiment.  
I would like you (students) to work on a data science project as a team and collaborate in GitHub to have an experience that is as close as possible to the professional world that you can find outside.
Once you get the foundations, you can practice more, find interesting projects, contribue and also put this in your resume when you look for work in the future.
