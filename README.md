# Repository created for the course YSC4224

This is an experiment.  
I would like you (students) to work on a data science project as a team and collaborate in GitHub to have this as an experience that is as close as possible to the professional world that you can find outside without too many complexities.

Once you get the foundations, you can practice more, find interesting projects, contribue and also put this in your resume when you look for work in the future :smile: .

We will implement the code for Linear Regression with Gradient Descent.
You will practice:
* Team collaboration and different roles you can play in the team.
* Individual Contributor Work.
* Learn one way to use git and GitHub to collaborate with the team to complete a project.

You will practice how teams can collaborate to complete projects or create joint codebase for new products.

## A Generic Team Structure

A project will leverage a specific structure depending on the objectives to achieve. 
A generic project would have the following roles:
* **Project Manager**: responsible for overseeing the project, tracking progress, and ensuring that team meets deadlines.
* **Data Scientist**: responsible for selecting and implementing the appropriate data science techniques to solve the specific problem. Responsible for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data.
* **Data Engineer**: responsible for setting up the infrastructure for the project, including the data storage, retrieval, and processing systems.
* **Data Visualizer**: responsible for creating visualizations to help understand the data and insights.
* **Code Reviewer**: responsible for reviewing the code of the other team members, providing feedback, and ensuring that the code meets the standards set by the team.
* **Tester**: responsible for testing the code and the application to ensure that it meets the requirements and performs as expected.
For our project everyone can take any role, but everyone will be a Individual Contributor (IC) and a team member.

## Linear Regression with GD

What is Provided:
* Detailed Instructions
* Code instructions to complete
* This GitHub Repository for each team
* A template Trello board for project management
* Help online:
	* Use documentation first, try to understand the problem and the solutions
	* Use stackoverflow or similar
	* Use ChatGTP (but you still need to explain what you have done) 
* Help in class: 
	* Free collaboration within the team
	* No collaboration across teams
	* Can ask 2 questions max to me if you are stuck. 

You will submit your code in this repo and then the final notebook / script with in Canvas

You can come up with your own implementation or follow the instructions provided in class.
